# React Filter Text

This is just sample filter text demo built with React, Webpack.  
I created this for my learning.  

[View Demo](https://chocolat5.github.io/react-filter-text-demo/)

* Use `filter()` for filter posts by text entered in `input`
* Use `async / await` for filter posts after `handleChange`
